## About Me

Hi, I am currently a lead security engineer at Rapid7, working on offensive security research and
content for the Metasploit Project. I am also formerly part of Exploit-DB for exploit verification,
and security research for Corelan. I have been active in the security community for about ten years,
and I have a lot of love for reverse engineering, vulnerability reserach, exploit development, or
anything associated with that. This website intends to collect some of the interesting things I have
published on the web.

I also love animals, and I have a soft spot for dogs and cats!
