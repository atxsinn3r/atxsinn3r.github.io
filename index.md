## About Me

Hi, I am currently a vulnerability research consultant at Dell. Before that, I worked as a lead
security engineer under the offensive security research branch for Metasploit (of Rapid7). I am
also formerly part of Exploit-DB for exploit verification in the early days, and I was a member
of the Corelan team doing security research. I have been active in the security community for
about ten years, and I have a lot of love for reverse engineering, vulnerability, exploit
development, or anything associated with that. This website collects some of the interesting
things I have published on the web.

I also love animals, and I have a soft spot for dogs and cats! I had a dog named Missy, who
passed away in 2019 at the age of 10... I miss her a lot.
