## About Me

Hi, I am currently a vulnerability research consultant at a large tech corporation.

Before that, I worked as a lead security engineer under the offensive research branch for
Metasploit (of Rapid7). I was part of Exploit-DB for exploit verification in the early days,
and I was a member of the Corelan team doing security research. I have been active in the
security community for about ten years, and I have a lot of love for reverse engineering,
vulnerability, exploit development, or anything associated with that.

I also love animals, and I have a soft spot for dogs and cats! I had a dog named Missy, who
passed away in 2019 at the age of 10... I miss her a lot. I also have another dog named
Mocha, who is overly affectionate. They are like my own kids.
