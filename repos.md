## Repositories

**Metasploit Framework**

I have been an active contributor for the Metasploit Framework since 2011, and have earned the highest
committer status since [Nov 2015](https://twitter.com/_sinn3r/status/669939749591851008) (data from OpenHub). Most of my work at Metasploit
can be found on the Github repository as an [author](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Awchen-r7) or an [assignee](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pulls?q=is%3Apr+assignee%3Awchen-r7+is%3Aclosed), but it does not include records
from the SVN days.

**Poodle**

This is currently a private repository. It is a PoC framework for exploits written in C++ utilizing
the Boost framework, supporting Linux (Debian) and Mac, also as a Docker image.

**VulnCases**

This is a repository that hosts a collection of vulnerable cases I have written for experimental
purposes. Sometimes I may throw in proofs on how to exploit them, as well. If you are interested
in exploit development, you may want to check this out.

**AMSIScanner**

This is a C++ example of how to use Microsoft's AMSI API to perform a malware scan with C++. The
purpose of AMSI is to allow you to integrate your application to support malware scanning,
but it is beneficial for offensive research too.

**EyeDiff**

This is an EXPERIMENTAL tool written in Ruby that allows pentesters to go through screenshots with a GUI,
and identify potentially easy targets to exploit. It is no longer maintained.

**Patch-Finder**

This is a Ruby tool that is intended for vulnerability researchers to collect Microsoft patches quickly
from their security bulletins. It has a modular design that allows you to find patches from
different search engines (such as Technet, or Google). This repository is no longer maintained, but
worked great when I needed to find patches for Internet Explorer or other Microsoft products.
